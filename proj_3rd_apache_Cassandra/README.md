project from (docker in action) chapter 4
i tried it, found some errors in the boook and putted the fixed codes
i didn't know how to put the commands in an executable way for you all.
it's not just like a docker file which you build or something... just commands ... in the first 4 chapters i just read, i wonder why the book writer did that.
